# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format:
**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, e.g. `1.0.1`

-  **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
-  **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
-  **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Insyall the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changed due to  keyring changes. So we needed refer ton the latest install CLI  via Terraform Documentation and change the scripting for install.

### Considerations for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubuntu.
Please consider checking your Linux Distribution to see and change accordingly to distribution needs.

Example of checking OS Version:

```sh
$ cat /etc/os-release

PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues we notice that bash scripts steps were aconsiderable amount more code. So we decided to create a bash script to install the Terraform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This will keep the Ditpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allow us an easier to debug and execute manually Terraform CLI install
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

#### Shebang Considerations

A Shebang (pronounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program that will interpet the script. e.g. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- for portability for different OS 
- will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

#### Execution Considerations

When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script

e.g. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the scriptr to a program to interpert it.

e.g. `source ./bin/install_terraform.cli`

#### Linux Permissions Considerations

In order to make our bash scripts executable we need to change linux permission for the fix to be exetuable at the user mode.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

alternatively: 

```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### Github Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init becouse it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace.

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks

### Working Env Vars 

### env command

We can list out all Enviroment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can filter specific env vars using grep e.g. `env | grep AWS_`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='word'`

In the terminal we can unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```

Within a bash script we can set env without writing export e.g.

```sh

#!/usr/bin/bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO

```

#### Printing Vars

We can print an env var using echo e.g. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want to Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. e.g. `.bash_profile`

#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```sh
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in thoes workspaces.

You can also set env vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-sensitive env vars.

### AWS CLI Installation

AWS CLI is installed for this project via the bash scriprt [`./bin/install_aws_cli`](./bin/install_aws_cli)



[Getting Started install (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

[AWS CLI Env Vars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

We can check if our AWS credentials is configured correctly by running the following AWS CLI command:

```sh

aws sts get-caller-identity

```

If it is succesful you should see a json payload return that looks like this:

```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDA739FN5K663LW2ZSL6",
    "Account": "123456789012",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/terraform-beginner-bootcamp"
}
```
